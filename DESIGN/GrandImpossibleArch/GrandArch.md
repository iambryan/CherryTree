the reactive opeartional transformation architecture

ideas:

relational database: how to efficiently decleartively query stuff. all the good stuff
	1. data should be acyclic, manage pointers by references please!
	2. data should be normalized, alghough what means by normalized changes with your app
material data: like case classes, pure, decidible equality, immutable
yinwang: database with richer type system and saner syntax, without giving up the query abilities
rethinkdb: reactive query!
graphql: your backend looks like a database, but you are not necessarily talking directly to a database
operational transformation: first order 1. changes, 2. mergable, 3. conflict resolution
RxJava, FRP: express logics as a computation dependency graph
react: view as pure functions
Binding.scala: view as pure functions, without diffing
diffable data structure

transcations
stablize
....


===========

what does it looks like, a collebrative text editor 


the thing is, with OT, the seperation of backend and frontend is artifical, it can be moved anywhere, or act like a local app. so we assume that our app is a local app.


then
