a OT editor such that:

all data is cached locally, visible to all users, maybe with modification control

ot with rich semantics

simple backend - live query is something fancy, but too hard for now

goal will be cover usage of:

* org mode
* paper manager
* it's own settings?
  or should we have a embedded language,
   and this language will 
   handle all settings?

=========


new order:
* a ot gen library
* a doc gen library

basic goals, in order of importance
* plain text editing
* vim supported navigation and editing
* markdown viewing, with all functionality in Vimflowy-like software
* support VERY LARGE document
* collaborative or/and built in source control
   * offline editing
   
this is actually already something very new

there is even more goals, that might NOT be realizable at all. **currently we don't consider them as goals**

* non-modal, mouse interface

grand goals
* rich semantics
   * general data types, with programmable pure, dependent programming language 
* structural/rich text editing

non-goals, at least now

complex layout algorithm and layout parameters like LaTeX
